          The suggestions provided are generated through an advanced AI model,
          OpenAI API 4o-mini. This tool analyzes user comments on a given
          YouTube video and extracts valuable insights.

          By examining feedback, questions, and opinions from viewers, the AI
          generates recommendations that can help creators improve their
          content, engage with their audience more effectively, and address
          common concerns or queries.
