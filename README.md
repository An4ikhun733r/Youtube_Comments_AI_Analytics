## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of powerful tools and technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the ETL pipeline.
- **YouTube Data API**: To extract comments from specified YouTube videos.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for storing and managing comment data.
- **PGAdmin4**: A web-based database management tool for PostgreSQL, facilitating database administration and query execution.
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating the ETL workflow, ensuring seamless scheduling and execution of tasks.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: To analyze the comments and generate insightful suggestions for improving video content.

## Features

- **Extract**: Automatically fetch comments from YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API.
- **Transform**: Clean and preprocess the comments data, ensuring it is ready for analysis. This involves various transformations, including text normalization and sentiment analysis.
- **Load**: Store the transformed data in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the comments and provide tailored suggestions for improving content based on audience feedback.
- **CSV Export**: Generate a CSV file containing all comments and the corresponding AI-generated insights for easy sharing and review.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YouTube-Comments-ETL.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   cd YouTube-Comments-ETL
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database for storing the comments data.

4. **Configure API keys**:
   Set up your YouTube Data API credentials to allow access to fetch comments.

5. **Run the ETL pipeline**:
   Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate the ETL process. Start the Airflow server and trigger the ETL workflow to begin extracting comments.

## How It Works

The ETL process follows a structured workflow:

1. **Extraction**: The system calls the YouTube Data API to extract comments from specified videos.
2. **Transformation**: Extracted comments undergo cleaning and preprocessing. Text normalization, tokenization, and sentiment analysis are performed to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Loading**: Transformed comments are loaded into a PostgreSQL database, where they can be efficiently queried and analyzed.
4. **AI Analysis**: Machine learning models analyze the comments, generating insights and suggestions for content improvement.
5. **Output Generation**: A CSV file is created, containing all comments along with AI-generated suggestions.

## Output

The final output of the project is a CSV file containing:

- All comments extracted from the YouTube video
- AI-generated suggestions for improving video content based on the analysis of audience feedback

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing advanced sentiment analysis techniques for deeper insights.
- Adding support for multiple video sources.
- Creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ETL process and viewing insights.
- Incorporating more AI features to enhance content suggestions based on emerging trends.
